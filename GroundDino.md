Methods：

- Insight： The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization
- we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into **three phases and propose a tight fusion solution**, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion
